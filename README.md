Tao Web Server
==============

Simple web-server for the [Web application architecture and frameworks](http://cs.petrsu.ru/~akolosov/web-arch/) course written in Python.

This web server is made 1) for fun; 2) in accordance with the next Tao Te Ching verse:
> Without going out the door, know the world  
> Without peering out the window, see the Heavenly Tao  
> The further one goes  
> The less one knows  

which (I believe) in this context mean "To understand essentials of the Web-server architecture you could simply write your own".
